# Software_Security_22EW4

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  The company was Artemis Financial.  They since they deal with personnal and private information of their customers, they wanted us to apply best best practices as far as updated software security to their system.  
# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  I feel that I correctly identified the areas that the company lacked security in.  It is important to code securely becuase if not, you leave the possiblilty for personal and provide information to be exposed or used for some type of ransom.  The value that software security adds, is that long term, the company could save millions in trying to fix an issue that is 90% preventable.
# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  Using the process flow vulnerability diagram helped me focus on the areas that I thought were the most important.  It actually gave a visual instruction of what to look for.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  I increased the layers of security by adding incryption keys using Algorithm Ciphers.  I made sure to give access to only those who were granted that access.  the authentication for that access was verified before access to that person was granted.  

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  Well, after the refactoring, I applied used the security libraries to deply and implement the encryption algorithm ciper to the software application
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Definitely Maven, encryption, and refactoring.


# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I would let them know that I am familier with the latest and greatest SDLC methodologies.  I would explain in detail my portfolio and some of the projects that I have successfully completed.  I would discuss with the this potential employer that I understand the importance of SSI, which stands for software security initiative.  I would ensure that the potential eomployer understands that I am passoinate about my profession, and that I would love to make the cyber would a better and more secure place.
